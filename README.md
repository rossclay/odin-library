# odin-library
Library project from The Odin Project.

Known issues:
Slider functionality - Only the first slider on the page actually does anything. And when it's clicked, instead of updating only the 'read-status' of its own card, it updates every card on the page.
DisplayBook Function - When adding new book to the page, the displayBook function adds ALL of the books in the library, even if they are already on the page.
